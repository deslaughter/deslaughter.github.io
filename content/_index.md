# Hello, I'm Derek Slaughter.

{{< intro >}}
I'm a mechanical engineer and software developer, and I model, analyze, and optimize systems.
{{< /intro >}}

As a Fuel Mechanical Dynamics engineer at [Framatome](https://www.framatome.com/), I simulate fuel assemblies in nuclear reactors under faulted conditions, such as earthquakes or accidents, to demonstrate safe operation.

This site documents my personal projects and is a work in progress.
