# Hello!

I'm Derek Slaughter.

I'm a **mechanical engineer** and **software developer**, and I analyze, model, and optimize systems.

I currently work as a Fuel Mechanical Dynamics engineer at [Framatome](https://www.framatome.com/) simulating fuel assemblies in nuclear reactors under faulted conditions (earthquakes, accidents, etc.) to demonstrate safe operation.

This site documents my personal projects and is a work in progress.
